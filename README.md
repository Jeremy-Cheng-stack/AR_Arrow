# Augmented Reality Arrow
 
 This project is created using Unity and Vuforia. 
 
 Download the assets file and import into a unity project to use.
 
 It requires a Canadian $5 bill to use as a target then an arrow should just hover above it as the object.
 
 To start the AR, press play in Unity then give permission to use camera.
